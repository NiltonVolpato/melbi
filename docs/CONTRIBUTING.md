# Contributing to Melbi

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Melbi! This document outlines well-defined, reasonably independent sub-projects that are suitable for external contributors.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the development guide**: See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for building, testing, and development workflow
2. **Understand TDD approach**: We follow strict Test-Driven Development - write tests first, then implement
3. **Check existing issues**: Look for issues tagged `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
4. **Ask questions**: Open a discussion or issue if anything is unclear

## Project Opportunities

We've organized contribution opportunities by difficulty level. Each project includes estimated time, required skills, and specific files to modify.

---

## 🟢 Easy Projects (2-10 hours)

Perfect for first-time contributors or getting familiar with the codebase.

### ~~1. Complete Display Implementations for Complex Types~~ ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETED**

**Description**: ~~Implement `Display` trait for Map and Symbol types, which currently show placeholder addresses.~~ Map Display is complete. Symbol type doesn't have a runtime representation yet (no symbol literals exist), so Symbol Display is N/A.

**Why contribute this**:
- Quick win with immediate visible impact
- Clear specification (follow the Function Display implementation we just completed)
- Improves debugging and error messages
- Good introduction to Melbi's value system

**Skills Required**:
- Basic Rust (traits, pattern matching)
- Understanding of Display vs Debug traits

**Files to Modify**:
- `core/src/values/dynamic.rs` (lines 72-77 for Map, lines 94-98 for Symbol)
- `core/src/values/display_test.rs` (add tests similar to function Display tests)

**Success Criteria**:
- Map displays as `<Map @ 0x...: {key_type => value_type}>`
- Symbol displays with meaningful information
- All tests pass
- Both Display and Debug implementations

**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours

**Why contribute this**:
- Significantly improves developer experience
- Well-defined task (grep for `span: None`)
- Learn Melbi's error handling architecture
- Non-breaking change

**Skills Required**:
- Basic Rust
- Understanding of source spans
- Reading error flow through call stacks

**Files to Modify**:
- `core/src/evaluator/eval.rs` (lines 359, 369, and others with `span: None`)
- `core/src/evaluator/error.rs` (ensure span is propagated)
- Add tests verifying error spans are correct

**Success Criteria**:
- All evaluator errors include source spans where available
- Error messages point to exact location in source
- Tests verify span accuracy

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### 3. Improve CLI with Subcommands

**Description**: Add proper CLI modes: `melbi eval`, `melbi check`, `melbi fmt`, `melbi run <file>`.

**Why contribute this**:
- User-facing improvement with immediate value

- Existing REPL code provides examples
- Clear requirements from MVP roadmap

**Skills Required**:
- Rust basics
- clap library (already used in the project)
- File I/O

**Files to Modify**:
- `cli/src/main.rs` (currently 215 lines - needs expansion)
- Add integration tests in `cli/tests/`

**Required Subcommands**:
- `melbi eval "1 + 2"` - evaluate expression and print result
- `melbi check script.melbi` - type-check file without running
- `melbi fmt script.melbi` - format file (or `--check` for CI)
- `melbi run script.melbi` - evaluate file and print result
- Keep existing REPL as default with no args

**Success Criteria**:
- All four subcommands work correctly
- Help text is clear and complete

- Good introduction to Criterion.rs
- Learn Melbi's evaluation system

**Skills Required**:
- Rust basics
- Criterion.rs (examples already exist in the codebase)

- Clear specification from existing arithmetic operators
- High impact - enables actually useful programs

**Skills Required**:
- Rust (intermediate level)
- PEST parser grammar
- Type system basics
- Pattern matching

**Files to Modify**:
1. **Parser** (`core/src/parser/expression.pest`):
   - Add comparison operator grammar rules

2. **Parser** (`core/src/parser/parser.rs`):
   - Add operator precedence handling
   - Add to Pratt parser

3. **Analyzer** (`core/src/analyzer/analyzer.rs`):

- proptest or quickcheck library
- Understanding of property-based testing concepts
- Melbi language semantics

**Files to Create**:
- `core/tests/property_tests.rs` (or multiple files by category)
- Integration with existing test infrastructure

**Example Properties to Test**:

1. **Parser Properties**:
   - Parsing is deterministic
   - Format preserves semantics: `parse(format(parse(x))) ≈ parse(x)`
   - Invalid syntax always produces parse error

2. **Type Checker Properties**:
   - Type checking is deterministic
   - Well-typed programs don't produce type errors
   - Type inference is consistent

3. **Evaluator Properties**:
   - Evaluation produces values matching their types
   - Arithmetic properties: commutativity, associativity
   - Array operations preserve length correctly

4. **Formatter Properties**:
   - Idempotency: `format(format(x)) == format(x)`
   - Parsing succeeds: `parse(format(x))` succeeds if `parse(x)` succeeds
   - Semantics preserved: `eval(format(x)) == eval(x)`

**Success Criteria**:
- At least 20 meaningful properties tested
- Tests find edge cases (document any bugs found!)
- Integration with `cargo test`
- CI runs property tests

**Estimated Time**: 20-30 hours

## 🔴 Hard Projects (30+ hours)

Complex projects requiring deep understanding of compiler/interpreter architecture.

### 9. Constant Folding Optimization ⭐ **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE**

**Description**: Implement compile-time evaluation of constant expressions on the typed AST.

**Why contribute this**:
- **Competitive advantage** - CEL doesn't do this
- Clear performance win (eliminate runtime computation)
- Well-defined optimization pass
- Independent of other features

**Skills Required**:
- Rust (advanced level)
- Compiler optimization techniques
- AST traversal and transformation
- Deep understanding of Melbi's type system
- Arena allocation patterns

**Files to Create/Modify**:

- `core/src/optimizer/constant_folding.rs` (main implementation)
- `core/src/analyzer/typed_expr.rs` (may need modifications)
- Integration with compilation pipeline
- Comprehensive tests and benchmarks

**Implementation Approach**:

1. **Operate on TypedExpr** (after type checking):
   - Input: Typed AST from analyzer
   - Output: Optimized AST with constants folded
   - Preserve all type information and spans

2. **Fold Constant Expressions**:
   - Arithmetic: `2 + 3` → `5`
   - Boolean: `true and false` → `false`
   - String: `"hello" + " world"` → `"hello world"`
   - Conditionals: `if true then a else b` → `a`
   - Array/Record creation with constant elements

3. **Preserve Semantics**:
   - Don't fold expressions with side effects (if any)
   - Don't fold expressions that might error at runtime
   - Maintain span information for debugging

4. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Dead code elimination (unreachable branches)
   - Constant propagation through where bindings
   - Pre-compute array lengths, record field types

**Success Criteria**:
- Constant expressions are evaluated at compile time
- Semantics are preserved (same results as runtime eval)
- Spans preserved for error reporting
- Benchmarks show performance improvement
- All tests pass

**Estimated Time**: 30-50 hours
