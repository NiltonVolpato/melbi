# Welcome to Melbi

Melbi is a functional programming language with a powerful type system. Let's start with the basics!

## Your First Expression

The simplest Melbi program is just a value or expression. Try typing `1 + 1` in the playground on the right.

When you type, the playground automatically evaluates your code and shows:
- The **result** of the expression
- The **type** of the result

## Basic Arithmetic

Melbi supports standard arithmetic operations:

- Addition: `5 + 3`
- Subtraction: `10 - 4`
- Multiplication: `6 * 7`
- Division: `20 / 4`

Try changing the code on the right to experiment with different operations!

## What's Next?

In the next lesson, we'll learn how to define and use functions - the building blocks of Melbi programs.
